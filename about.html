  <h2>My Story</h2>
  <p>
    I'm Lalith Kumar. They say,<em><strong>From the Deepest Pains comes the Highest Purpose</strong></em>.
    Several years ago,I was almost nothing,I was just an <em>Innocent Featherhead Speech Impaired Fatso</em>.
    I used to be Bullied,Beaten,Ridiculed,Oppressed and taken advantage of. <strong><em>And,One day somebody very dear to me,left me</strong></em>.
    That,hit me hard and I was deeply moved. Everyday the trauma kept on growing and somewhere there,I realised that I was almost in the mouth of a Psychological Depression.
    That day,I felt like somebody is tearing me apart from inside,pain was unendurable and,It was then I turned to <em>God</em> to help me and provide me a soft succor.
    That's when <em>Divinity</em> and <em>Music</em> entered into my life. And, My Healing Process started. That's where,<em><strong>I decided to Change Myself Holistically</em></strong>.
    It took me,months of hardwork and perseverance,continually learning,working and improving myself day in and day out,to have a complete Transformation.
    When I completely Healed Myself,I realised something.I realised,there are people out there who are hurt,in pain,having nobody to stand by them,I had <em>God</em> and <em>Music</em> in my rescue but,what about others?
    That's when I said to myself,<em>I have to be there for people,I have to help people Heal and empower them to Live at their Best</em>.And,That moment <strong><em>I found My Life's Purpose</em></strong>...
